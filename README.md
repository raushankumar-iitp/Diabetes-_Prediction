# Diabetes-_Prediction

🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical input features such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age.
It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the popular PIMA Diabetes dataset.
All inputs are scaled using StandardScaler to improve model accuracy.
The project includes an interactive Streamlit web app where users can adjust sliders and instantly see predictions.
The main goal is to provide a simple, fast, and user-friendly health prediction tool.
This model is not a medical diagnosis — it is only for learning and educational purposes.
